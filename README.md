--> bitcoin brings blockchain technology into lime-light. bitcoin is a digitalgold or stored value that is used to make transaction between users in a decentralized manner.

--> ethereum akes this technology more further allowing people to create smartcontracts and trust minimized agreements.these smart contracts can access and interact with the real world using oracle network. chailink is a decentralized oracle network

-->Meta mask Wallet

-->first transaction

-->transaction fee:--> it is the amount paid in your native blockchain currency to nodes or validators or block producers who are running the blockchain in order to process the transaction

--> gas:--> it is unit of computational measurment of the transaction.(more complex the txn is more gas you have to pay

--> Gas price:--> price of 1 unit of gas to be charged for the transaction(the more people sending the txn at the same time the more will be the gas price)

--> Gas Used:--> it is basically total gas used for the transaction

--> Gas Limit:--> limit is set for the gas so that gas used cant cross this gas limit 

--> transaction fee is calculated as: Gas price * Gas Used

--> timestamp:--> when txn occurred

## How blockchain works

--> hash :-> A unique fixed length string used to identify the piece of data. they are created by placing said data into hash function

--> ethereum use keccak-256 hashing algo

--> Mining is the process of finding solution to the blockchain problem. Nodes get paid for mining the blocks.

--> block :- it is a list of transactions mined together it contain block-No, Nonce, data(list of txt), prevhash, hash

--> blockchains are decentralized having no single point of authority. all the blockchains nodes compared with each other to see which blockchain working honestly and which one is working maliciously.

--> Nonce:--> Nonce may be used for no. of  different reasons. number used to find the solution of the blockchain problem . it is also used to define the transaction number for an account/address

--> private-key generates--> public-key--> then your account address 

--> private-key:- who send the transaction how to identify the txn on the blockchain. transaction are signed using private 
key in order to identify signature is on the txn. then using ECDA algo the the private key converted to pubic key to verify that the particular txn is signed by you
